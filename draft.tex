\section{Introduction}

\section{Preliminaries}

A \emph{signature} $\sig = (\ssorts{\sig},\sfuns{\sig})$ consists of a
set $\ssorts{\sig}$ of \emph{sort symbols} and a set $\sfuns{\sig}$ of
sorted \emph{function symbols}. To simplify the presentation, we
assume w.l.o.g. that $\ssorts{\Sigma}$ consists of two distinct sorts
$\Data$ and $\Bool$ and each function symbol $f \in \sfuns{\sig}$ has
$\#(f) \geq 0$ arguments of sort $\Data$ and return value $\sigma(f)
\in \ssorts{\sig}$. If $n=0$, $f$ is a \emph{constant} of sort
$\sigma(f)$ and we consider the constants $\top,\bot \in \sfuns{\sig}$
of sort $\Bool$, denoting the truth values true and false.

We consider an infinite countable set of \emph{variables} $\vars$,
where each $x \in \vars$ has an associated sort $\sigma(x)$. Terms are
defined recursively: a term $t$ of sort $S$ is a variable $x \in
\vars$ where $\sigma(x)=S$, or $f(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(f)})$ where
$t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(f)}$ are terms of sort $\Data$ and $\sigma(f)=S$. An
\emph{atom} is a term of sort $\Bool$ or an equality $t \teq s$
between two terms of sort $\Data$. A \emph{literal} is an atom or its
negation. A \emph{formula} is a combination of atoms using disjunction
$\vee$, conjunction $\wedge$ and negation $\neg$.  A formula is in
disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is a disjunction of conjunctions
of literals $\bigvee_{i=1}^N \bigwedge_{j=1}^{M_i} \ell_{ij}$.

An \emph{interpretation} $\I$ maps\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item the sort $\Data$ into a non-empty set $\Data^\I$, 
\item the $\Bool$ sort into the set $\Bool^\I$ containing the boolean
  values, and
\item each function symbol $f$ into a total function $f^\I :
  (\Data^\I)^{\#(f)} \rightarrow \sigma(f)^I$, or an element of
  $\sigma(f)^I$ when $\#(f)=0$.
\end{inparaenum}
