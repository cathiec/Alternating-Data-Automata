\section{Definitions}

Let $Q$ be a finite set of predicates, where for each $q \in Q$, we
denote by $\#(q)\geq0$ its arity. We denote by $Q_0$ the subset of $Q$
consisting of predicates of arity zero. By $\Sigma$ we denote a
finite set of symbols, called alphabet.

We consider an infinite countable set $\vars$ of first-order
variables, ranging over $\nat$, and we associate each predicate $q \in
Q$ a tuple of arguments $\vec{x}_q = \tuple{x_{q,1}, \ldots,
  x_{q,\#(q)}}$ such that, for any two $p,q \in Q$, $\vec{x}_p$ and
$\vec{x}_q$ have no elements in common, when $p \neq q$.
