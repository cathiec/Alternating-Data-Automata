\section{Preliminaries}

For two integers $0 \leq i \leq j$, we denote by $[i,j]$ the set
$\set{i,i+1,\ldots,j}$ and by $[i]$ the set $[0,i]$. To simplify the
presentation, we consider two sorts $\Data$ and $\Bool$, where $\Data$
is an infinite domain and $\Bool$ is the set of truth values $\top$
(true) and $\bot$ (false). The $\Data$ sort is equipped with finitely
many function symbols $f : \Data^{\#(f)} \rightarrow \Data$, where
$\#(f)\geq0$ denotes the number of arguments (arity) of $f$. When
$\#(f)=0$, we say that $f$ is a constant. A \emph{predicate} is a
function symbol $p : \Data^{\#(p)} \rightarrow \Bool$, denoting a
relation of arity $\#(p)$ and we write $\preds$ for the set of
predicates. In the following, we shall consider that the
interpretation of all function symbols $f : \Data^{\#(f)} \rightarrow
\Data$ that are not predicates is fixed and relative to the
interpretation of the $\Data$ sort. For simplicity, we further blur
the notational distinction between function symbols and their
interpretations.

Let $\vars = \set{x,y,z,\ldots}$ be an infinite countable set of
variables, ranging over the interpretation of the $\Data$ sort. Terms
are either constants of sort $\Data$, variables or function
applications. The set of first-order formulae is defined by the syntax
below:
\[\phi := t \teq s \mid p(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(p)}) 
\mid \neg \phi_1 \mid \phi_1 \wedge \phi_2 \mid \exists x ~.~
\phi_1 \] where $t,s,t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(p)}$ denote terms. We write
$\phi_1 \vee \phi_2$, $\phi_1 \rightarrow \phi_2$ and $\forall x ~.~
\phi_1$ for $\neg(\neg\phi_1 \wedge \neg\phi_2)$, $\neg\phi_1 \vee
\phi_2$ and $\neg\exists x ~.~ \neg\phi_1$, respectively. We denote by
$\fv{}{\phi}$ the set of free variables in $\phi$. A \emph{sentence}
is a formula $\phi$ in which each variable occurs under the scope of a
quantifier, i.e. $\fv{}{\phi} = \emptyset$. A formula is
\emph{positive} if each predicate symbol occurs under an even number
of negations. The size $\len{\phi}$ of a formula $\phi$ is the number
of symbols needed to write it down.

%% For a variable $x \in \fv{}{\phi}$ and a term $t$, let $\phi[t/x]$ be
%% the result of replacing each occurrence of $x$ by $t$. For indexed
%% sets of terms $T=\set{t_1,\ldots,t_n}$ and variables
%% $X=\set{x_1,\ldots,x_n}$, we write $\phi[T/X]$ for the formula
%% obtained by simultaneously replacing each occurrence of $x_i$ with
%% $t_i$ in $\phi$, for all $i\in[n]$.

An \emph{interpretation} $\I$ maps each predicate $p$ into a set $p^\I
\subseteq \Data^{\#(p)}$, if $\#(p)>0$, or into an element of $\Data$
if $\#(p)=0$. A \emph{valuation} $\nu$ maps each variable $x$ into an
element of $\Data$. Given a term $t$, we denote by $t^\nu$ the value
obtained by replacing each variable $x$ by the value $\nu(x)$ and
evaluating each function application. For a formula $\phi$, we define
the forcing relation $\I,\nu \models \phi$ recursively on the
structure of $\phi$, as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\I,\nu \models t \teq s & \iff & t^\nu=s^\nu \\
\I,\nu \models p(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(p)}) & \iff & \tuple{t_1^\nu,\ldots,t_{\#(p)}^\nu} \in p^\I \\
\I,\nu \models \neg\phi_1 & \iff & \I,\nu \not\models \phi_1 \\
\I,\nu \models \phi_1 \wedge \phi_2 & \iff & \I,\nu \models \phi_i \text{, for all } i=1,2 \\ 
\I,\nu \models \exists x ~.~ \phi_1 & \iff & \I,\nu[x\leftarrow d] \models \phi_1 \text{, for some } d \in \Data 
\end{array}
\]
For a formula $\phi$, we define $\sem{\phi}_\nu \isdef \set{\I \mid
  \I,\nu \models \phi}$, where $\nu(x)$ is defined for each $x \in
\fv{}{\phi}$, and drop the subscript for sentences. A sentence $\phi$
is \emph{satisfiable} (\emph{unsatisfiable}) if
$\sem{\phi}\neq\emptyset$ [$\sem{\phi}=\emptyset$]. An element of
$\sem{\phi}$ is called a \emph{model} of $\phi$. A formula $\phi$ is
\emph{valid} if $\I,\nu \models \phi$ for every interpretation $\I$
and every valuation $\nu$.

Interpretations are partially ordered by the pointwise subset order,
defined as $\I_1 \subseteq \I_2$ if and only if $p^{\I_1} \subseteq
p^{\I_2}$ for each predicate $p \in \preds$. Given a set $\mathcal{S}$
of interpretations, a minimal element $\I \in \mathcal{S}$ is an
interpretation such that for no other interpretation $\I' \in
\mathcal{S} \setminus \set{\I}$ do we have $\I' \subseteq \I$. For a
formula $\phi$ and a valuation $\nu$, we denote by $\minsem{\phi}_\nu$
and $\minsem{\phi}$ the set of minimal interpretations from
$\sem{\phi}_\nu$ and $\sem{\phi}$, respectively.

\section{First Order Alternating Automata}

Let $\Sigma$ be a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ of \emph{input
  events}. Given a finite set of variables $X$, we denote by $X
\mapsto \Data$ the set of valuations of the variables $X$ and
$\Sigma[X] = \Sigma \times (X \mapsto \Data)$ be the possibly infinite
set of \emph{data symbols} $(a,\nu)$, where $a$ is an input symbol and
$\nu$ is a valuation. A \emph{data word} (simply called word in the
following) is a finite sequence $w=(a_1,\nu_1)(a_2,\nu_2) \ldots
(a_n,\nu_n)$ of data symbols. Given a word $w$, we denote by
$\event{w} \isdef a_1\ldots a_n$ its sequence of input events and by
$\data{w}$ the valuation associating each time-stamped variable
$\stamp{x}{i}$ the value $\nu_i(x)$, for all $x \in \vars$ and
$i\in[1,n]$. We denote by $\varepsilon$ the empty sequence, by
$\Sigma^*$ the set of finite sequences of input events and by
$\Sigma[X]^*$ the set of data words over the variables $X$.

A \emph{first-order alternating automaton} (simply called automaton in
the following) is a tuple $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$,
where $\Sigma$ is the finite event alphabet, $X$ is a finite set of
variables, $Q$ is a finite set of predicates, $\iota$ is a satisfiable
sentence, $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of \emph{final} predicates and
$\Delta$ is a set of \emph{transition rules} of the form
\(q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi\), where $q \in Q$ is a
predicate, $a \in \Sigma$ is an input event, $X \cap
\set{y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}} = \emptyset$, $\psi$ is a positive formula
such that $\fv{}{\phi} \subseteq X \cup \set{y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}}$
and each predicate that occurs in $\psi$ belongs also to $Q$. The
\emph{size} of $\A$ is defined as $\len{\A} = \len{\iota} +
\sum_{\scriptscriptstyle{q(\vec{y}) \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta}}
\len{\psi}$.

The intuition of a transition rule \(q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)})
\arrow{a(X)}{} \psi\) is the following: $a$ is the input event and $X$
are the input data values that trigger the transition, whereas $q$ and
$y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}$ are the current control state and data values
in that state, respectively. Without loss of generality, we consider,
for each predicate $q \in Q$ and each input event $a \in \Sigma$, at
most one such rule --- two or more rules can be joined using
disjunction.

The execution semantics of automata is given in close analogy with the
case of boolean alternating automata, with transition rules of the
form $q \arrow{a}{} \phi$, where $q$ is a boolean constant and $\phi$
a positive boolean combination of such constants. For instance, $q_0
\arrow{a}{} q_1 \wedge q_2 \vee q_3$ means that the automaton can
choose to transition in either both $q_1$ and $q_2$ or in $q_3$
alone. This intuition leads to saying that the steps of the automaton
are defined by the minimal boolean models of the transition
formulae. In this case, both $\set{q_1 \leftarrow \top, q_2 \leftarrow
  \top, q_3 \leftarrow \bot}$ and $\set{q_1 \leftarrow \bot, q_2
  \leftarrow \bot, q_3 \leftarrow \top}$ are minimal models, however
$\set{q_1 \leftarrow \top, q_2 \leftarrow \top, q_3 \leftarrow \top}$,
is a model but is not minimal\footnote{To avoid the confusion of
  considering potentially non-minimal models, the original definition
  of alternating finite-state automata \cite{ChandraKozenStockmeyer81}
  uses boolean valuations instead of formulae.}.

Given a predicate $q \in Q$ and a tuple of data values
$d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}$, the tuple $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$ is called
a \emph{configuration}\footnote{Note that a configuration is not a
  logical term since data values cannot be written in logic.}. To
formalize the execution semantics of automata, we relate sets of
configurations to models of first-order sentences, as follows. Given a
formula $\phi$ and a valuation of its free variables $\nu$, each
interpretation $\I \in \sem{\phi}_\nu$ corresponds to a set of
configurations $\cube{\I} \isdef \set{q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}) \mid
  \tuple{d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}} \in q^\I, q \in Q}$, called a
\emph{cube}. For a set $\mathcal{S}$ of interpretations, we define
$\cube{\mathcal{S}} \isdef \set{\cube{\I} \mid \I \in
  \mathcal{S}}$. Given a word $w=(a_1,\nu_1) \ldots (a_n,\nu_n) \in
\Sigma[X]^*$, an \emph{execution} of
$\A=\tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$ over $w$ is a (possibly
infinite) forest $\T = \set{T_1,T_2,\ldots}$, where each tree $T_i$ is
such that:
\begin{compactitem}
\item the roots of $T_1, T_2, \ldots$ form a cube from
  $\cube{\minsem{\iota}}$, % --- because $\iota$ is satisfiable, such
                           % a cube always exists,
%
% \item all paths from the root to a leaf of $T_i$ have length $n$, and
%
\item if $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$ is a node on the level $j \in
  [n-1]$ in $T_i$, then its children form a cube from
  $\cube{\minsem{\psi}_\eta}$, where \(q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)})
  \arrow{a_{j+1}(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta\) is a transition rule and
  $\eta$ is a valuation that assigns each variable $y_k$ the value
  $d_k$, for $k \in [1,\#(q)]$ and each variable $x \in X$ the value
  $\nu_{j+1}(x)$. % --- because $\fv{}{\psi} \subseteq X \cup
                  % \set{y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}}$, the values assigned
                  % by $\eta$ to variables outside $X \cup
                  % \set{y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}}$ have no impact on
                  % $\cube{\minsem{\psi}_\eta}$.
\end{compactitem}
An execution $\T$ over $w$ is said to be \emph{accepting} if and only
if \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item all paths in $\T$ have the same length $n$, and
\item the frontier of each tree $T \in \T$ is labeled with \emph{final
  configurations} $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$, where $q \in F$ is a
  final predicate.
\end{inparaenum} In this case, we say that $\A$ accepts $w$ and
denote by $\lang{\A}$ the set of words accepted by $\A$. We address
the following questions: \begin{compactenum}
\item \emph{boolean closure}: given automata $\A_i =
  \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q_i,\iota_i,F_i,\Delta_i}$, for $i=1,2$, do there
  exist automata $\A_\cap$, $\A_\cup$ and $\overline{\A}_1$ such that
  $L(\A_\cap) = L(\A_1) \cap L(\A_2)$, $L(\A_\cup) = L(\A_1) \cup
  L(\A_2)$ and $L(\overline{\A}_1) = \Sigma[X]^* \setminus L(\A_1)$ ?
%
\item \emph{emptiness}: given an automaton $\A$, is $L(\A) =
  \emptyset$?
\end{compactenum}

\subsection{Symbolic Execution}

In the upcoming developments it is more convenient to work with
logical formulae defining executions. Let $\A =
\tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$ be an automaton for the rest of
this session. For any $i \in \nat$, we denote by $\stamp{Q}{i} =
\set{\stamp{q}{i} \mid q \in Q}$ and $\stamp{X}{i} = \set{\stamp{x}{i}
  \mid x \in X}$ the sets of time-stamped predicates and variables,
respectively. As a shorthand, we write $\stamp{Q}{\leq n}$ (resp.
$\stamp{X}{\leq n}$) for the set $\set{\stamp{q}{i} \mid q \in Q, i
  \in [n]}$ (resp. $\set{\stamp{x}{i} \mid x \in X, i \in [n]}$). For
a formula $\psi$ and $i \in \nat$, we define $\stamp{\psi}{i} \isdef
\psi[\stamp{X}{i}/X,\stamp{Q}{i}/Q]$ the formula in which all input
variables and state predicates (and only those symbols) are replaced
by their time-stamped counterparts. For a sequence of input events
$\alpha = a_1 \ldots a_n$, the \emph{path formula} of $\alpha$ (in
$\A$) is defined as:
\[\pathform{\alpha} \isdef \stamp{\iota}{0} \wedge 
\bigwedge_{i=1}^n \bigwedge_{q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a_i(X)}{}
  \psi \in \Delta} \forall y_1 \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~
\stamp{q}{i-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \stamp{\psi}{i}\]
The automaton $\A$, to which $\pathform{\alpha}$ refers, will always
be clear from the context. To formalize the relation between the
low-level configuration-based execution semantics and the symbolic
path formulae, consider a word $w=(a_1,\nu_1) \ldots (a_n,\nu_n)$. Any
execution forest $\T$ of $\A$ over $w$ is associated an interpretation
$\I_{\T}$ of the set of time-stamped predicates $\stamp{Q}{\leq n}$,
defined as:
\[\I_{\T}(\stamp{q}{i}) \isdef \set{\tuple{d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}} \mid
  q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}) \text{ occurs on level $i$ in $\T$}}\]

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:path-formula}
  Given an automaton $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$, for any
  word $w=(a_1,\nu_1) \ldots (a_n,\nu_n)$, we have 
  \(\minsem{\pathform{w_\Sigma}}_{w_\Data} = \set{\I_{\T} \mid \T
    \text{ is an execution of $\A$ over $w$}}\). 
\end{lemma}
\proof{ ``$\subseteq$'' Let $\I$ be a minimal interpretation such that
  $\I,w_\Data \models \pathform{w_\Sigma}$. We show that there exists
  an execution $\T$ of $\A$ over $w$ such that $\I = \I_\T$, by
  induction on $n\geq 0$. For $n=0$, we have $w=\epsilon$ and
  $\pathform{w_\Sigma} = \stamp{\iota}{0}$. Because $\iota$ is a
  sentence, the valuation $w_\Data$ is not important in $\I,w_\Data
  \models \stamp{\iota}{0}$ and, moreover, since $\I$ is minimal, we
  have $\I \in \minsem{\stamp{\iota}{0}}$. We define the
  interpretation $\J(q)=\I(\stamp{q}{0})$, for all $q \in Q$. Then
  $\cube{\J}$ is an execution of $\A$ over $\epsilon$ and $\I =
  \I_{\cube{\J}}$ is immediate. For the inductive case $n>0$, we
  assume that $w=u\cdot(a_n,\nu_n)$ for a word $u$. Let $\J$ be the
  interpretation defined as $\I$ for all $\stamp{q}{i}$, with $q \in
  Q$ and $i \in [n-1]$, and $\emptyset$ everywhere else. Then
  $\J,u_\Data \models \pathform{u_\Sigma}$ and $\J$ is moreover
  minimal. By the induction hypothesis, there exists an execution $\G$
  of $\A$ over $u$, such that $\J = \I_\G$. Consider a leaf of a tree
  $T \in \G$, labeled with a configuration $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$
  and let $\forall y_1 \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~
  \stamp{q}{n-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \stamp{\psi}{n}$ be
  the subformula of $\pathform{w_\Sigma}$ corresponding to the
  application(s) of the transition rule $q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)})
  \arrow{a_n}{} \psi$ at the $(n-1)$-th step. Let $\nu$ be the
  valuation that assigns each $y_i$ the value $d_i$, for all $i \in
  [1,\#(q)]$ and behaves like $w_\Data$ outside of
  $\set{y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(d)}}$. Because $\I, w_\Data \models \forall
  y_1 \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~
  \stamp{q}{n-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \stamp{\psi}{n}$,
  we have $\I \in \sem{\stamp{\psi}{n}}_{\nu}$ and let $\K$ be one of
  the minimal interpretations such that $\K \subseteq \I$ and $\K \in
  \sem{\stamp{\psi}{n}}_{\nu}$. It is not hard to see that $\K$ exists
  and is unique, otherwise we could take the pointwise intersection of
  two or more such interpretations. We define the interpretation
  $\overline{\K}(q) = \overline{\K}(\stamp{q}{n})$ for all $q \in
  Q$. We have that $\overline{\K} \in \minsem{\psi}_{\nu}$ --- if
  $\overline{\K}$ was not minimal, $\K$ was not minimal to start with,
  contradiction. Then we extend the execution $\G$ by appending to
  each node labeled with a configuration $q(d_1, \ldots, d_{\#(q)})$
  the cube $\cube{\overline{\K}}$. By repeating this step for all
  leaves of a tree in $\G$, we obtain an execution of $\A$ over $w$.
  
  ``$\supseteq$'' Let $\T$ be an execution of $\A$ over $w$. We show
  that $\I_{\T}$ is a minimal interpretation such that $\I_{\T},
  w_\Data \models \pathform{w_\Sigma}$, by induction on $n \geq
  0$. For $n=0$, $\T$ is a cube from $\cube{\minsem{\iota}}$, by
  definition. Then $\I_{\T} \models \stamp{\iota}{0}$ and moreover, it
  is a minimal such interpretation. For the inductive case $n > 0$,
  let $w=u\cdot(a_n,\nu_n)$ for a word $u$. Let $\G$ be the
  restriction of $\T$ to $u$. Consequently, $\I_\G$ is the restriction
  of $\I_\T$ to $\stamp{Q}{\leq n-1}$. By the inductive hypothesis,
  $\I_{\G}$ is a minimal interpretation such that \(\I_{\G}, u_{\Data}
  \models \pathform{u_\Sigma}\). Since $\I_{\T}(\stamp{q}{n}) =
  \set{\tuple{d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}} \mid q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})
    \text{ occurs on the $n$-th level in $\T$}}$, we have $\I_{\T},
  w_\Data \models \varphi$, for each subformula $\varphi = \forall y_1
  \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~ \stamp{q}{n-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)})
  \rightarrow \stamp{\psi}{n}$ of $\pathform{w_\Sigma}$, by the
  execution semantics of $\A$. This is the case because the children
  of each node labeled with $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$ on the
  $(n-1)$-th level of $\T$ form a cube from
  $\cube{\minsem{\psi}_\nu}$, where $\nu$ is a valuation that assigns
  each $y_i$ the value $d_i$ and behaves like $w_\Data$,
  otherwise. Now supppose, for a contradiction, that $\I_{\T}$ is not
  minimal and let $\J \subsetneq \I_{\T}$ be an interpretation such
  that $\J,w_\Data \models \pathform{w_\Sigma}$. First, we show that
  the restriction $\J'$ of $\J$ to $\bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} \stamp{Q}{i}$
  must coincide with $\I_{\G}$. Assuming this is not the case,
  i.e.\ $\J' \subsetneq \I_{\G}$, contradicts the minimality of
  $\I_{\G}$. Then the only possibility is that $\J(\stamp{q}{n})
  \subsetneq \I_{\T}(\stamp{q}{n})$, for some $q \in Q$. Let
  $p_1(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(p_1)}) \arrow{a_n}{} \psi_1, \ldots,
  p_k(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(p_k)}) \arrow{a_n}{} \psi_k$ be the set of
  transition rules in which the predicate symbol $q$ occurs on the
  right-hand side. Then it must be the case that, for some node on the
  $(n-1)$-th level of $\G$, labeled with a configuration
  $p_i(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(p_i)})$, the set of children does not form a
  minimal cube from $\cube{\minsem{\stamp{\psi_i}{n}}}$, which
  contradicts the execution semantics of $\A$. \qed}

Next, we give a logical characterization of acceptance, relative to a
given sequence of input events $\alpha \in \Sigma^*$. To this end, we
extend the path formula $\pathform{\alpha}$ with a characterization of
the set of final states of $\A$: 

\[\accform{\alpha} \isdef \pathform{\alpha} \wedge \bigwedge_{q
  \in Q \setminus F} \forall y_1 \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~
\stamp{q}{n}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \bot\]

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:acceptance}
  Given an automaton $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$, for
  every word $w \in \Sigma[X]^*$, the following are
  equivalent: \begin{compactenum}
  \item\label{it1:lemma:acceptance} there exists an interpretation
    $\I$ such that $\I,w_\Data \models \accform{w_\Sigma}$, 
    %
  \item\label{it2:lemma:acceptance} $w \in \lang{\A}$. 
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lemma}
\proof{ ``$(\ref{it1:lemma:acceptance}) \Rightarrow
  (\ref{it2:lemma:acceptance})$'' Let $\I$ be an interpretation such
  that $\I,w_\Data \models \accform{w_\Sigma}$. By Lemma
  \ref{lemma:path-formula}, $\A$ has an execution $\T$ over $w$ such
  that $\I = \I_{\T}$. To prove that $\T$ is accepting, we show
  that \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item\label{it1:acceptance} all paths in $\T$ have length $n$ and
      that
    \item\label{it2:acceptance} the frontier of $\T$ is labeled with
      final configurations only. \end{inparaenum} First, assume that
  (\ref{it1:acceptance}) there exists a path in $\T$ of length $0 \leq
  m < n$. Then there exists a node on the $m$-th level, labeled with
  some configuration $q(d_1,\ldots,q_{\#(q)})$, that has no
  children. By the definition of the execution semantics of $\A$, we
  have $\cube{\minsem{\psi}_{\eta}} = \emptyset$, where
  $q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a_{m+1}(X)}{} \psi$ is the transition
  rule of $\A$ that applies for $q$ and $a_{m+1}$ and $\eta$ stands
  for $\nu[y_1 \leftarrow d_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)} \leftarrow
    d_{\#(q)}]$. Hence $\sem{\psi}_{\eta} = \emptyset$, and because
  $\I,\nu \models \accform{\alpha}$, we obtain that $\I,\eta \models
  q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \stamp{\psi}{m+1}$, thus
  $\tuple{d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}} \not\in \I(q)$. However, this
  contradicts the fact that $\I=\I_{\T}$ and that
  $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$ labels a node of $\T$. Second, assume that
  (\ref{it2:acceptance}), there exists a frontier node of $\T$ labeled
  with a configuration $q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})$ such that $q \in Q
  \setminus F$. Since $\I,\nu \models \forall y_1 \ldots \forall
  y_{\#(q)} ~.~ q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \bot$, by a
  similar reasoning as in the above case, we obtain that
  $\tuple{d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}} \not\in \I(q)$, contradiction.  

  ``$(\ref{it2:lemma:acceptance}) \Rightarrow
  (\ref{it1:lemma:acceptance})$'' Let $\T$ be an accepting execution
  of $\A$ over $w$. We prove that $\I_\T,w_\Data \models
  \accform{w_\Sigma}$. By Lemma \ref{lemma:path-formula}, we obtain
  $\I_\T,w_\Data \models \pathform{w_\Sigma}$. Since every path in
  $\T$ is of length $n$ and all nodes on the $n$-th level of $\T$ are
  labeled by final configurations, we obtain that $\I_\T,w_\Data
  \models \bigwedge_{q \in Q \setminus F} \forall y_1 \ldots \forall
  y_{\#(q)} ~.~ \stamp{q}{n}(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \bot$,
  trivially.  \qed}

In the following, it will be useful to define the set of data
valuations of a word by a formula without predicates. Given a sequence
of input events $\alpha = a_1 \ldots a_n$, let $\substform{\alpha}$ be
the formula obtained from $\pathform{\alpha}$, by successively
replacing in $\accform{\alpha}$: \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item\label{it1:substform} each occurrence of a predicate
  $\stamp{q}{i}(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$ by the formula
  $\stamp{\psi}{i+1}[t_1/y_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$, where
  $q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a_{i+1}(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta$ is
  the unique transition rule for $q$ and $a_i$, for all
  $i=0,\ldots,n-1$,
%
\item\label{it2:substform} each occurrence of a predicate
  $\stamp{q}{n}$, such that $q \in Q \setminus F$, by $\top$, and
%
\item\label{it3:substform} each occurrence of a predicate
  $\stamp{q}{n}$, such that $q \in F$, by $\bot$.
\end{compactenum}
Since there are no occurrences of predicates in $\substform{\alpha}$,
for each valuation $\nu : \stamp{X}{\leq n} \rightarrow \Data$, there
exists an interpretation $\I$ such that $\I,\nu \models
\substform{\alpha}$ if and only if $\J,\nu \models \substform{\alpha}$, 
for every interpretation $\J$. Thus we omit $\I$ and simply write $\nu
\models \substform{\alpha}$ in this case.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:subst}
  Let $\phi$ be a positive formula and let $q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$
  be the only predicate atom occurring within $\phi$. Then, for every
  valuation $\nu$ of $\fv{}{\phi}$ and every formula $\psi$ with no
  predicate occurrences, the following are
  equivalent: \begin{compactenum}
  \item\label{it1:prop:subst} $\nu \models \phi[\psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots,
      t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})]$, 
    %
  \item\label{it2:prop:subst} $\I,\nu \models \phi \wedge \forall y_1
    \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~ q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow
    \psi$, for some interpretation $\I$.
  \end{compactenum}
  where $y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)} \not\in \fv{}{\phi}$. 
\end{proposition}
\proof{ We give the proof in the case $\phi$ is quantifier-free. The
  generalization to a non-empty quantifier prefix is straightforward.
  ``$(\ref{it1:prop:subst}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it2:prop:subst})$'' We
  distinguish two cases:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item if $\nu \models \psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$
    then let $\I(q) = \set{\tuple{t_1^\nu,\ldots,t_{\#(q)}^\nu}}$ and
    $\emptyset$ everywhere else. We have $\I,\nu \models
    q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$ and, since $\phi$ is positive, replacing
    $\psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$ with
    $q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$ in $\phi$ does not change its
    satisfiability under $\I,\nu$, hence $\I,\nu \models
    \phi$. Moreover, $\nu \models \psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots,
      t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$ thus $\I,\nu \models \forall y_1 \ldots
    \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~ q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \psi$.
    %
  \item else $\nu \not\models \psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots,
    t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$ and let $\I$ be the interpretation assigning
    each predicate symbol with $\emptyset$. Then replacing
    $\psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$ with
    $q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$ in $\phi$ does not change its
    satisfiability under $\I,\nu$. Moreover, since $\I$ maps $q$ to
    $\emptyset$, we have $\I,\nu \models \forall y_1 \ldots \forall
    y_{\#(q)} ~.~ q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \psi$, trivially.
  \end{compactitem}

  ``$(\ref{it2:prop:subst}) \Rightarrow (\ref{it1:prop:subst})$'' We
  distinguish two cases: \begin{compactitem}
  \item if $\tuple{t_1^\nu, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}^\nu} \in \I(q)$, since
    $\I,\nu \models \forall y_1 \ldots \forall y_{\#(q)} ~.~
    q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \rightarrow \psi$, we have $\nu \models
    \psi[t_1/y_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]$. Since $\phi$ is
    positive, replacing $q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$ by $\psi$ in $\phi$
    does not change its satisfiability under $\nu$, hence $\nu \models
    \phi[\psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1, \ldots,
      t_{\#(q)})]$.
    %
  \item else $\tuple{t_1^\nu, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}^\nu} \not\in \I(q)$,
    that is $\I,\nu \not\models q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$. Then $\nu
    \models \phi[\bot/q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})]$ and we obtain $\nu
    \models \phi[\psi[t_1/y_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1,
      \ldots, t_{\#(q)})]$, because $\phi$ is positive, thus
    $\phi[\bot/q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})] \models \phi[\psi[t_1/y_1,
        \ldots, t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1, \ldots, t_{\#(q)})]$. \qed
  \end{compactitem}}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:substitution}
  Given an automaton $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$, for
  every word $w \in \Sigma[X]^*$, we have $w_\Data \models
  \substform{w_\Sigma}$ if and only if $w \in \lang{\A}$.
\end{lemma}
\proof{ By Lemma \ref{lemma:acceptance}, $w \in \lang{\A}$ if and only
  if $\I,w_\Data \models \accform{w_\Sigma}$, for some interpretation
  $\I$. By induction on the number of predicate atoms in
  $\accform{w_\Sigma}$, using Proposition \ref{prop:subst} in the
  inductive step, we prove that, $\I,w_\Data \models
  \accform{w_\Sigma}$ if and only if $w_\Data \models
  \substform{w_\Sigma}$. \qed}

\subsection{Closure Properties}

Given a positive formula $\phi$, we define the \emph{dual} formula
$\dual{\phi}$ recursively as follows:
\[\begin{array}{rclcrclcrcl}
\dual{(\phi_1 \vee \phi_2)} & = & \dual{\phi_1} \wedge \dual{\phi_2} && 
\dual{(\phi_1 \wedge \phi_2)} & = & \dual{\phi_1} \wedge \dual{\phi_2} &&
\dual{(t \teq s)} & = & \neg(t \teq s) \\
\dual{(\exists x ~.~ \phi_1)} & = & \forall x ~.~ \dual{\phi_1} && 
\dual{(\forall x ~.~ \phi_1)} & = & \exists x ~.~ \dual{\phi_1} && 
\dual{(\neg(t \teq s))} & = & t \teq s \\
\dual{(q(x_1,\ldots,x_{\#(q)}))} & = & q(x_1,\ldots,x_{\#(q)})
\end{array}\]
Observe that, because predicate atoms do not occur negated in $\phi$,
there is no need to define dualization for formulae of the form $\neg
q(x_1,\ldots,x_{\#(q)})$. The following theorem shows closure of
automata under all boolean operations:

%% The dualization operation has the following property:
%% \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:dual}
%%   Given a formula $\phi$ and an automaton
%%   $\A=\tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$, we have the equivalence
%%   $\Accept{F}{\phi} \equiv \neg(\dual{\Accept{Q\setminus F}{\phi}})$. 
%% \end{lemma}
%% \proof{ By straightforward induction on the structure of $\phi$. \qed}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:closure}
  Given automata $\A_i = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q_i,\iota_i,F_i,\Delta_i}$,
  for $i=1,2$, such that $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$, the following hold: 
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item\label{it1:thm:closure} $\lang{\A_\cap} = \lang{\A_1} \cap \lang{\A_2}$, where
      $\A_\cap = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q_1 \cup Q_2, \iota_1 \wedge \iota_2,
      F_1 \cup F_2, \Delta_1 \cup \Delta_2}$, 
      %
    \item\label{it2:thm:closure} $\lang{\overline{\A_i}} = \Sigma[X]^*
      \setminus \lang{\A_i}$, where $\overline{\A_i} =
      \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q_i,\dual{\iota},Q_i\setminus
        F_i,\dual{\Delta}_i}$ and, for $i=1,2$: \[\dual{\Delta}_i =
      \set{q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a(X)}{} \dual{\psi} \mid
        q(y_1,\ldots,y_{\#(q)}) \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi \in
        \Delta_i}\enspace.\]
  \end{compactenum}
  Moreover, $\len{\A_\cap} = \bigO{\len{\A_1}+\len{\A_2}}$ and
  $\len{\overline{\A_i}} = \bigO{\len{\A_i}}$, for all $i=1,2$.
\end{theorem}
\proof{ (\ref{it1:thm:closure}) ``$\subseteq$'' Let $w \in
  \lang{\A_\cap}$ be a word and $\T$ be an execution of $\A_\cap$ over
  $w$. Since $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$, it is possible to partition
  $\T$ into $\T_1$ and $\T_2$ such that the roots of $\T_i$ form a
  cube from $\cube{\minsem{\iota_i}}$, for all $i=1,2$. Because
  $\Delta_1 \cap \Delta_2 = \emptyset$, by induction on
  $\len{w}\geq0$, one shows that $\T_i$ is an execution of $\A_i$ over
  $w$, for all $i=1,2$. Finally, because $\T$ is accepting, we obtain
  that $\T_1$ and $\T_2$ are accepting, respectively, hence $w \in
  \lang{\A_1} \cap \lang{\A_2}$. ``$\supseteq$'' Let $w \in
  \lang{\A_1} \cap \lang{\A_2}$ and let $\T_i$ an accepting execution
  of $\A_i$ over $w$, for all $i=1,2$. We show that $\T_1 \cup \T_2$
  is an execution of $\A_\cap$ over $w$, by induction on
  $\len{w}\geq0$. For the base case $\len{w}=0$, we have $\T_i \in
  \cube{\minsem{\iota_i}}$ for all $i=1,2$ and since $Q_1 \cap Q_2 =
  \emptyset$, we have $\T_1 \cup \T_2 \in \cube{\minsem{\iota_1 \wedge
      \iota_2}}$. The induction step follows as a consequence of the
  fact that $\Delta_1 \cup \Delta_2$ is the set of transition rules of
  $\A_\cap$. Finally, since both $\T_1$ and $\T_2$ are accepting,
  $\T_1 \cup \T_2$ is accepting as well. Moreover, we have: 
  \[
  \len{\A_\cap} = \len{\iota_1 \wedge \iota_2} + \sum_{q(\vec{y})
    \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta_1 \cup \Delta_2} \len{\psi} =
  1 + \len{\iota_1} + \len{\iota_2} + \sum_{q(\vec{y})
    \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta_1} \len{\psi} + \sum_{q(\vec{y})
    \arrow{a(X)}{} \psi \in \Delta_2} \len{\psi} \enspace. 
  \]

  \noindent(\ref{it2:thm:closure}) Let $w \in \Sigma[X]^*$ be a
  word. We denote by $\accformA{\A_1}{w_\Sigma}$ and
  $\substformA{\A_1}{w_\Sigma}$
  [resp. $\accformA{\overline{\A}_1}{w_\Sigma}$ and
    $\substformA{\overline{\A}_1}{w_\Sigma}$] the formulae
  $\accform{w_\Sigma}$ and $\substform{w_\Sigma}$ for $\A_1$ and
  $\overline{\A}_1$, respectively. It is enough to show that
  $\substformA{\overline{\A}_1}{w_\Sigma} =
  \neg\substformA{\A_1}{w_\Sigma}$ and apply Lemma
  \ref{lemma:substitution} to prove that $w \in \lang{\A_1} \iff w
  \not\in \lang{\overline{\A}_1}$. Since the choice of $w$ was
  arbitrary, this proves $\lang{\overline{\A}_1} = \Sigma[X]^*
  \setminus \lang{\A_1}$. By induction on the number of predicate
  atoms in $\accformA{\A_1}{w_\Sigma}$ that are replaced during the
  generation of $\substformA{\A_1}{w_\Sigma}$. The proof relies on the
  following fact:

  \begin{fact}\label{fact:dual-neg}
    Let $\phi$ be a positive formula and let $q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})$
    be the only occurrence of a predicate symbol within $\phi$. Then,
    every formula $\phi$ with no predicate occurrences:
    $\neg\phi[\psi[t_1/y_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})]
    \equiv
    \dual{\phi}[\neg\psi[t_1/y_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)}/y_{\#(q)}]/q(t_1,\ldots,t_{\#(q)})]$.
  \end{fact}
  \proof{By induction on the structure of $\phi$. \qed}}

\section{The Emptiness Problem}

The problem of checking emptiness of a given automata is undecidable,
even for automata with predicates of arity two whose transition rules
use only equalities and disequalities, with no quantifiers
\cite{Farzan15}. Since there is no decision procedure even in the most
simple case, we use an abstraction-refinement semi-algorithm based on
\emph{lazy annotation} \cite{McMillan06,McMillan14}. In a nutshell, a
lazy annotation procedure systematically explores the set of execution
traces of a program in search for a counterexample. When a spurious
counterexample is found, the search backtracks and the program path is
annotated with a set of learned facts, that excludes the path from
future searches. In general, these facts are interpolants extracted
from the proof of spuriousness of the given (finite) path.

Typically, in a lazy annotation procedure that checks the
unreachability of a given control state in a program (or, more
generally, the infeasability of a set of non-linear Horn clauses
\cite{BjornerGurfinkelMcMillanRybalchenko15}), the interpolants used
to annotate the unfolded control structure are local assertions about
the values of the program variables. These assertions define
overapproximations of the set of configurations reachable at a given
control state.

When considering an alternating model of computation, computing local
interpolants involving a single control state is not possible anymore,
because of the fact the several branches of the computation
synchronize on the same sequence of input values. Consider, for
instance, an automaton with the following transition rules:
\[\begin{array}{rclcrcl}
q_0(y) & \arrow{a(x)}{} & q_1(y+x) \wedge q_2(y-x) & \hspace*{2mm} & 
q_1(y) \arrow{a(x)}{} y+x > 0 \\
q_1(y) & \arrow{a(x)}{} & q_1(y+x) && q_2(y) \arrow{a(x)}{} y-x > 0 \\
q_2(y) & \arrow{a(x)}{} & q_2(y-x)
\end{array}\]
When started in an initial configuration $q_0(0)$, on an input word
$(a,k_1) \ldots (a,k_n)$, the automaton executes as follows: 
\[q_0(0) \arrow{(a,k_1)}{} q_1(k_1)
\wedge q_2(-k_1) \ldots \arrow{(a,k_{n-1})}{} q_1(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}
k_i) \wedge q_2(-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} k_i) \arrow{(a,k_n)}{}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i > 0 \wedge \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i < 0\] A fairly good
overapproximation of the set of cubes generated after the initial
configuration is given by the formula $\exists x_1 \exists x_2 ~.~
q_1(x_1) \wedge q_2(x_2) \wedge x_1+x_2 \teq 0$. Observe that a
formula using one occurrence of a predicate would give a too rough
overapproximation of this set, unable to prove the emptiness of the
automaton. 

The rest of this section is concerned with the building blocks of a
lazy annotation semi-algorithm for checking emptiness of automata. In
particular, we address the following problems: \begin{compactenum}
%
\item generation of interpolants that prove the infeasability of a
  given path formula, provided that the satisfiability of the
  first-order theory thereof is decidable, in the presence of
  predicate symbols.
%
\item generation of non-local interpolants using history variables,
  obtained by Skolemization of the universal quantifiers that occur
  within transition rules.
%
\item computing the coverage between two node labels in the unfolding
  of an automaton, when history variables occur. 
\end{compactenum} 
Based on these results, we show how a version of the classical
\textsc{Impact} \cite{McMillan06} semi-algorithm can be used to
(dis-)prove the emptiness of first-order alternating automata. 

\subsection{Lyndon Interpolants}

Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be first-order formulae, such that $\phi \wedge
\psi$ is unsatisfiable. The \emph{vocabulary} of $\phi$, denoted as
$\voc{\phi}$, is the set of function symbols that occur in $\phi$.  By
$\pset{+}{\phi}$ [$\pset{-}{\phi}$] we denote the set of predicate
symbols that occur in $\phi$ under an even (odd) number of
negations. A \emph{Lyndon interpolant} \cite{Lyndon59} for $\phi$ and
$\psi$ is a first-order formula $I$ such that: \begin{compactitem}
\item $\phi \rightarrow I$ is valid,  
\item $I \wedge \psi$ is unsatisfiable, 
\item $\voc{I} \subseteq \voc{\phi} \cap \voc{\psi}$, 
\item $\pset{+}{I} \subseteq \pset{+}{\phi} \cap \pset{+}{\psi}$ and
  $\pset{-}{I} \subseteq \pset{-}{\phi} \cap \pset{-}{\psi}$.
\end{compactitem}
The existence of Lyndon interpolants for first-order logic was proved
by a non-constructive model-theoretic argument \cite{Lyndon59}. For
now, we silently assume that the satisfiability problem for the theory
in which $\phi$ and $\psi$ are written is decidable and, moreover,
that a decision procedure generating Lyndon interpolants exists, for
this theory. This is a rather unrealistic assumption, given that
classical decidable theories, such as Presburger arithmetic, become
undecidable in the presence of (monadic) predicate symbols
\cite{Halpern91}.

Let $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$ be an automaton for the
rest of this section. Given a non-empty sequence of input events
$\alpha = a_1 \ldots a_n \in \Sigma^*$, a \emph{local interpolant} for
$\alpha$ is a sequence $I_0,I_1,\ldots,I_n$ of first-order formulae
such that: \begin{compactitem}
\item $\iota \rightarrow I_0$ is valid, 
%
\item $\left[I_k \wedge \left(\bigwedge_{q(\vec{y}_q) \arrow{a_i(X)}{} \psi}
  \forall \vec{y}_q ~.~ \stamp{q}{k}(\vec{y}_q) \rightarrow
  \nextf{\psi}\right)\right] \rightarrow \nextf{I}_{k+1}$ is valid, for all $k \in [n-1]$,
%
\item $I_n \wedge \left(\bigwedge_{q \in Q \setminus F} \forall \vec{y}_q
  ~.~ q(\vec{y}_q) \rightarrow \bot\right)$ is unsatisfiable,
%
\item $\voc{I_k} = \pset{+}{I_k}$ and $\pset{-}{I_k} = \emptyset$. 
\end{compactitem}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:lyndon-existence}
  
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Skolem Witnesses} 

\subsection{Lazy Annotation} 


Assuming that the data domain is countable, the set of finite words
$\Sigma[X]^*$ is countable and the emptiness problem is recursively
enumerable. Moreover, by Lemma \ref{lemma:acceptance}, a systematic
enumeration of sequences of input events $\alpha \in \Sigma^*$ will
eventually discover an accepted word, provided that all path formulae
$\pathform{\alpha}$ belong to a decidable first-order theory.




However, if the automaton is empty, the enumeration of input event
sequences will fail to terminate, in general. The classical way to
fight this divergence problem is to consider a \emph{coverage} partial
order, which is a subset of the following relation: 

\begin{definition}\label{def:coverage}
  Given an automaton $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$ and
  $S_1, S_2 \subseteq \bigcup_{q \in Q} \set{q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)})
    \mid d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)} \in \Data}$, we have $S_1 \sqsubseteq
  S_2$ if and only if 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:po}
    \text{
      \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
        $\A$ accepts a word $w$ when started in a set of cubes $C_1
        \in S_1$ only if $\A$ accepts $w$ when started in a set of
        cubes $C_2 \in S_2$.
    \end{minipage}} 
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
Since, in general the $\sqsubseteq$ relation is not definable using
available decidable (SMT) theories, we consider the following stronger
relation: $S_1 \supsetforex S_2$ if and only if, for each set of cubes
$C_1 \in S_1$, there exists a set of cubes $C_2 \in S_2$ such that
$C_1 \supseteq C_2$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:coverage}
  Given an automaton $\A = \tuple{\Sigma,X,Q,\iota,F,\Delta}$, for any
  sets of cubes $S_1, S_2 \subseteq \bigcup_{q \in Q}
  \set{q(d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)}) \mid d_1,\ldots,d_{\#(q)} \in \Data}$
  such that $S_1 \supsetforex S_2$, we have $S_1 \sqsubseteq S_2$.
\end{lemma}
